### Styleguide
---

A gulp flavored styleguide inspired by Huge's styleguide, utilizing jade/json but in a cleaner, extendable format.
Includes Browserify, sourcemaps, sass minification/concatenation, auto bower setup and concatenation of files, browser-sync, gh-pages and more.

Just run `gulp` and you're good to go. Easy peazy titty squeezy.

Want to push it to github pages? Run `gulp gh-pages`. Boom goes the dynamite.

### ToDo's
Consider https://github.com/assemble/assemble

This styleguide works as a standalone but can possibly be included within your project and separated by example below gulpfile.js in your main project:
// require('./gulp');
// require('./styleguide/gulp');
